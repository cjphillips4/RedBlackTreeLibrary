BackEndDeveloper README for Project Two (CS400 @ UW Madison)
========================================================
Name of BackEndDeveloper: Connor Phillips
@wisc.edu Email of BackEndDeveloper: cjphillips4@wisc.edu
Group: HF
Team: RED
Files Written by Me:Backend.java: Holds our red black tree that stores all books in the library.  The backend also fetches the books, genres, and 
	all other info related to books stored in tree
TestBackend.java:  Tests the functionality of several methods in the Backend class.  
	In the proposal I had a testClear() method listed, however we realized this was a method that we would not be using so 
		after getting permission from our group TA, I changed it to a testGetALlGenres() method.
